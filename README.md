# RaafiRahman.com
An updated personal website and portfolio. New technologies were used in this that were not present in the previous version. This new portfolio uses Javascript along with React and Node rather than a Python and Flask framework. The previous version only used HTML and CSS. The whole website was rebuilt from scratch with a focus on aesthetics and ease of use. Mobile users were also kept in mind this time around. The whole website had a facelift along with drastic visual and functional changes. [See for yourself](https://www.raafirahman.com/)
